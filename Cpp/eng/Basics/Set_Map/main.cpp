  // Let's investigate how does a vector work under the hood.

  // not break, every element to the right needs to be moved one element
  // to the right to free up space.
  // arr = {2, _, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1}
  // This leads to O(n) time complexity on .erase() method,
  // where n is the number of elements to the right.
  // Method .push_back() however works in O(1), because no elements are moving.
  // It works the same way with .erase() and .pop_back() methods.

  // The last trick I am going to share is how reallocating works.
  // When we first stated our vector to have n elements, but then
  // decided to add some more, there happens to be no space to the right!
  // What vector does is it allocates new block of memory that is twice as
  // big as the previous one and copies values from the old place to the new one.
  // Surprisingly, this results in O(n) time and space complexity.
  // Let's proof this.
  // Let the initial size of the array be 1.
  // We will add elements until there are 'n' of them.
  // The first time vector will reallocate 1 element, then 2, then 4 and so on.
  // This equals to the following sum:
  // 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^(floor(log(n)))
  // floor(x) is rounding down.
  // Let floor(log(n)) = k.
  // In other words, k is the maximum power of two where reallocation will happen.
  // 1 + 2 + 4 + ... + 2^k
  // Let's interpret these numbers in binary:
  // 1 + 10 + 100 + ... + 100..00
  // 00001
  // 00010
  // 00100
  // 01000
  // -k---
  // 01111
  // We can clearly see, that 2^(k + 1) is greater than our sum.
  // On the other hand, 2^(k + 1) is at most twice as big as 'n'.
  // Therefore, we get O(2*n) = O(n) time and space complexity.
  // This is already implemented in vector. No need to worry.
  // .capacity() method tells us how many elements are currently allocated
  // for this vector.
  cout << "Vector size is " << arr.size() << endl;
  cout << "Vector capacity is " << arr.capacity() << endl;
  cout << "Adding 123 at the end of array" << endl << endl;
  arr.push_back(123);
  cout << "Now vector size is " << arr.size() << endl;
